RIOT - A React-like user interface micro-library
================================================

CUSTOM TAGS • ENJOYABLE SYNTAX • VIRTUAL DOM • TINY SIZE.

Imagine writing custom tags without jumping into a morass of JavaScript
and framework dependencies. In Riot, you start with HTML and add
JavaScript. Riot then converts your HTML and script to pure JavaScript
that runs in all browsers.

It's stunningly simple without sacrificing power. Riot is minimal but
complete with observables and routing included. It's tiny at 8.6 KB
(yes, 8.6). And yet Riot goes toe-to-toe with the big boys including
advanced capabitites like Transclusion, Multi-Transclusion and nested
custom tags.

If you're an Angular or React programmer you really owe it to yourself
to check out Riot. You'll understand it entirely in an hour and wonder
why someone didn't think of this sooner.
